Once your program launches you should see the SCS Splash Screen, followed by the Valkyrie simulation. Click the `Simulate` button. Valkyrie should settle and balance in a standing position.

<a name="walk"></a>To make Valkyrie walk, type "walk" in the Variable search field. Find the variable named "walk", and set it's value to "1.0". If Valkyrie does not start walking, click the `Simulate` button, and Valkyrie should begin the flat ground walking track script. Congratulations! Everything is installed correctly!

If the simulation 'crashes', you will need to quit it and restart from your IDE.
