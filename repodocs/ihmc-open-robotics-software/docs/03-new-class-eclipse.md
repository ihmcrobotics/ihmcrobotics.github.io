 ### Open the Java Perspective

You'll want to have the Java Perspective open before you create and edit your class.  After importing the Gradle Project you are often left with the Gradle Tasks window open and the Java Perspective minimized. Click the maximize perspective button on the right of the Eclipse IDE window to expand the Java Perspective.

Once expanded you should see the `GradleProject` selected on the left and `Java` on the top right.

Java classes are organized by "packages". Many IHMC packages start with `us.ihmc`, you can use your organization, a personal website, or whatever you'd like as your package. Here we're going to use `us.ihmc.demo` as the package, and `ValkyrieDemo` as the name of the class. Fill out this information and click `Finish`:

Fill in the class to look like the following:

<pre><code data-url-index="0" data-snippet="complete" id="ValkyrieDemo"></code></pre>
